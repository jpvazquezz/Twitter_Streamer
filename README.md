# Twitter_Streamer

This project intends to create a basic Twitter streamer to collect tweets in real time. I applied the streamer to analyse the repercussion of the first 2020 US Presidential Election debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

The repository is composed of:
* streamer.py - the code for the streamer iself
* settings.py - the necessary code for the streamer's configuration
* dump.py - the code for converting the tweets' database into csv file
* tweets.db and tweets.csv - the collected tweets in database and csv formats 
* Data_Analysis.ipynb - the tweets' analysis notebook
